- My name is McKay Christensen and I am a recent graduate of BYU's Master's of Statistics. Currently, I work at Aetna, a CVS Health Company as an actuary in the Actuarial Development Program.

- As an actuary, I am improving my business acumen as I help to grow our Individual Exchanges business. My current role is to analyze claims experience from our rapidly growing block of business by creating SQL data pulls tailored to our business needs and building/managing executive dashboards to explain current experience to leadership.

- I have a passion for data and have experience building machine learning models both in school and the workplace. Throughout my career, I hope to merge data science and actuarial science work through data analysis and ML methods. 

- Currently, I am studying for the SOA's Advanced Topics in Predictive Analytics exam and am improving my Python skills, especially those tailored to model development and training.
